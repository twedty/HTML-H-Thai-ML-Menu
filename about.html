        <p>We know that when someone is drunk, incapacitated, or otherwise not in the right mind, that it may be quite hard to remember a name to a place that one may want to eat at. So, what better way than to have a name that sticks out? In Idiotville, Oregon we figured that the best way to retain our roots was to make a name that resembled our town as well. From here, we've spread out to many different and unique locations that completely coincide and work with our name as a whole.</p>
